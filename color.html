    <span style="color:red;""> is the process of exposing the relevant things and ignoring the irrelevant details. The easiest way to
understand and appreciate this concept of handling complexity</span> is by studying the example of Globe, a
model/prototype of earth that is used by students to understand its geography. Globe provides only that
information that is required and if too much of information is mentioned in it i.e. streets, lakes etc, it becomes too
complex to comprehend.

    Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and keeps both safe from
outside interference and misuse. The data is not accessible to the outside world and only those functions that are
wrapped in the class can access it. These functions provide the interface between the objectâ€™s data and the
program. The insulation of the data from the direct access by the program is called data hiding.
In OOP, code and data are merged into an object

<p>
    important because it supports the concept of hierarchical classification.. Inheritance provides the idea of
reusability of code and each sub class defines only those features that are unique to it.
Polymorphism is a feature that allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. An operation may
exhibit different behavior in different instances. The behavior depends on the types of data used in the operation.
It plays an important role in allowing objects having different internal structures to share
